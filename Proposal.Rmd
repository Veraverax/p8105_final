#### The tentative project title

**Wine Rating - What's behind great wines?**

#### The motivation for this project

This dataset offers us a great opportunity to explore what factors are associated with wine ratings. We hope to conduct regression analysis of the wine rating and price based on location/grape type/notes/region and see if there are significant difference among these categorical predictors. The regression model would help customer estimate and predict wine rating with a series of wine characteristics. We also want to provide people with a interactive website to visualize wine rating and prices.

#### The intended final products

There will be four sectors in the final website. The first one would be a descriptive statistics and static visualization page. The second part will be the regression analysis results. The third part will be interactive plots showing detailed information of wine characteristics. The fourth part will be a world map with wine rating information.

#### The anticipated data sources

The data for this project is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. It was scraped on November 22nd, 2017 from WineEnthusiast Rating database (https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine). It contains 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, description and reviewer information. 

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

##### Data Cleaning
 
1\) Work with NA variablesï¼›2) Categorize white/red/other wine type; 3) Extracting flavor/notes info from the text description; 4) Recode categorical variables for regression analysis

##### Visualization

* Static plot: 1) Distribution of price/rating by region; 2) Distribution of price/rating by grape typ; 3) Distribution of rating by reviewer (TBD)

* Interactive Map: 1) Generate coordinate data from city/region; 2) Use shiny for user preference specific viewing; 3) Plot the wine info within a global map

##### Regresssion Analysis

* Outcome variable - rating: Run a multiple linear regression model with wine rating on several predictors (price/grape type/winery/flavor/region) and conduct regression diagnostics

* Outcome variable - price: Run a multiple linear regression model with wine price on several predictors (rating/grape type/winery/flavor/region) and conduct regression diagnostics

##### Coding Challenges: 
1\) Extract notes information from the text description; 2) Generate coordiates using some packages; 3)Level of significance of the regression model; 4) Missing/duplicate data problem
